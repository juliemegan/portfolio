This page was built using HTML, Javascript, jQuery, PHP and Bootstrap. It was initially hosted
via Apache 2.4 during the development phase. I utilized my time commuting to Chicago from 
the suburbs via the Metra train rail to develop this page over the span of a few months.
It took several iterations to design the look and feel I was attempting for this page. 
My page was inspired by the picture below. Feedback is welcomed!
