After an amazing five years in Hawaii dedicated to obtaining my Computer Science and living out 
my dream of living on Oahu, I returned back to the Chicagoland area to be closer to friends and 
family. Since returning, I have taken a position with the Intercontinental Exchange in Chicago 
as a Release Management Analyst. I have learned an immense amount of valuable information on the 
sys admin/engineering side of software development which has helped me to understand the end-to-end 
process to a degree which I had not before.

Besides coding, in my free time I enjoy the outdoors, spending time with friends and family, movies, 
music, sports, exercise, fashion and dogs! I am always up for trying something new and stepping out of my 
comfort zone. I generally find people and the world around me incredibly interesting and full 
of wonder. Coffee is life.

Professionally I hope to continue to build my skill set and work my way up to a position where I 
have a valuable, impactful position in the decision-making process of application development 
end-to-end. I enjoy the challenge of finding the most efficient solution to the most complex of 
problems. I would love to inspire others and start my own firm in 5-10 years. Eventually, I see myself returning 
back to school to achieve a more advanced degree and end my career teaching at the collegiate 
level and inspiring our next generation of engineers and developers. I am passionate about coding and 
computer processes. If my Computer Science degree and computer technology experience has taught me 
nothing else, it has taught me how to think. Only those who have shared the same path will understand 
exactly what I mean by that. :)
